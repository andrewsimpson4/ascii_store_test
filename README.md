# ascii_store_test

To run the program enter terminal and cd into the project.. run `npm start` to fire up the server which should run on http://localhost:3000. After that simply open index.html in a browser which is found at the root of the directory.  

Creatella ,

For this project I dove into a quick and simple design for browsing and buying the ascii faces. The design is smooth, easy to filter and easy to understand. Also a self designed beautiful loading animation which you will see while loading the data.

This project was made for the web but was made in react native which means portability to other languages. The only third party module used(besides react native ;) ) is the Animatable modules which is used throughout the code. This insures simplicity and reduced the clutter of adding 100% custom animations.

One cool future is the auto row size change to the grid as you change the screen size of the window. 

Overall I feel the project went pretty good and Iâ€™m happy for how the project turnout for how quick it was. Although parts of the test documentation where a little unclear at parts(especially around how the backend worked) I believe I figured everything out :)

I hope you guys enjoy the project and I hope to hear from you guys soon
